# T-Bird
My experiments and libraries with T-Bird AVR development board.<br>
I'm using VSCode as an IDE and the C/CPP VSCode extension under Linux and Mac. VSCode tasks are available for compailing and flashing.<br>

## Organisation of the source code<br>
-**:file_folder:drivers**:This folder contains all the code which is related to drive external peripherials like LCD,7segment display, keyboad matrix etc.<br>
-**:file_folder:HAL**: This folder contains all the code which is related to the integrated peripherials (like SPI,I2C,TIMER)<br>
-**:file_folder:utils**: Everyting else<br>
